The active project instructions cover: opening briefing protocol, conversation lanes,
Doron's working style, Cursor prompt formatting rules, audit cadence, key documents,
decision filter, and do-not-do list.

See the project-level instructions (set by Doron in the Claude project settings) for the
canonical version of all conversation protocols.
