## Tagline

**"Local Lane — Where community be-comes alive."**

---

## Mission

**Keep money circulating locally.**

When you spend at a LocalLane business, that money stays in your community. It pays local wages, supports local families, and funds local dreams. We exist to make local commerce thrive — not through discounts, but through connection.

---

## Vision

**A living network that reflects community health.**

We're building the Organism — a system that mirrors the real vitality of a place. When people gather, create, move, and nourish together, the community comes alive. LocalLane makes that visible.

Every person has a creature. Every network has an organism. Every community has a heartbeat. What's true of the part is true of the whole.

## Values

### 1. Circulation Over Extraction

Money that stays is money that grows. We don't extract value from communities — we help it flow between neighbors. This is how prosperous communities have always worked.

### 2. Belonging Over Discounts

We don't sell coupons. We build networks. Community Pass members aren't bargain hunters — they're people who want to be part of something. The byproduct is savings. The cause is belonging.

### 3. Mirror, Don't Manipulate

The Organism reflects real participation — it doesn't manufacture artificial engagement. No streaks. No points. No guilt. Just an honest reflection of community life.

### 4. Less Choice, More Life

The paradox of choice says more options make us less happy. We curate, not catalog. LocalLane shows you what's alive in your community today — not 500 businesses to scroll through.

### 5. Win Together

Inspired by how tight-knit communities build wealth: pay each other well, support each other's work, keep resources circulating within the network. When one wins, we all win.

### 6. Truth Over Agreement

We want the best idea, not a yes. Honest feedback, constructive pushback, and creative reframing make everything better. Kind but honest. Relationships matter.

## The Frameworks We Build On

**Marketing From the Inside Out** (Busse & Maynard)
> "True marketing means aligning what you think (culture), what you say (message), and what you do (experience)."

The Organism IS this alignment. Culture, message, and experience unified.

**This Is Marketing** (Seth Godin)
> "Marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems."

The problem: money leaves town, community fragments, local businesses struggle.  
The solution: a network that keeps it circulating.

**The Paradox of Choice** (Barry Schwartz)
> "Learning to choose well in a world of unlimited possibilities is harder still, perhaps too hard."

We reduce choice anxiety. The Organism curates. The wizard guides. MyLane shows you what matters today.

## What We're NOT

- A coupon book
- A discount app
- A Yelp competitor
- A race to the bottom for local businesses

---

## What We ARE

A living network where:
- Members belong to something larger than transactions
- Businesses fill underutilized capacity with engaged locals
- Money circulates instead of extracts
- Community health becomes visible

---

## The Promise

**To members:** One pass. Your whole community. Access to experiences that keep money local and make your town feel alive.

**To businesses:** Engaged customers, not discount seekers. Revenue share based on real engagement. A network that grows together.

**To Eugene:** A heartbeat you can see.
