# Farm Program Launch Checklist

> Active launch checklist for LocalLane's content-first launch.
> The farm program is Phase 1 of the Launch Roadmap — real businesses, real events, zero code changes.
> Updated: 2026-02-02

---

## Outreach (Doron — This Week)

- [ ] Facebook post published (done 2026-02-02)
- [ ] Identify 3-5 target farm/food businesses in Eugene area
- [ ] Personal outreach to each (in-person or phone preferred over email)
- [ ] Pitch: "Free listing, free events, we handle the tech, you bring the community"
- [ ] Collect from each: business name, contact info, 1-2 sentence description, logo/photo if available

---

## Business Onboarding (Per Business)

For each farm/food business, walk them through:

- [ ] Create account on LocalLane
- [ ] Set up business profile (name, description, category, location, contact)
- [ ] Upload a photo or logo
- [ ] Create first event (farm tour, workshop, market day, etc.)
- [ ] Verify event appears on the public events page
- [ ] Show them the business dashboard (their events, RSVPs, stats)

### What to tell them:
- This is a free pilot — no cost, no commitment
- Events will be visible to the Eugene community on LocalLane
- They'll see RSVPs come in through their dashboard
- Feedback helps shape what gets built next

---

## Community Awareness

- [ ] Facebook post tracking responses (note who's interested)
- [ ] Share 1-2 real events once they exist (second Facebook post with links)
- [ ] Personal invites to 10-15 people you know who'd attend a farm event
- [ ] If any local groups (homeschool, community orgs) show interest, brief them

---

## Platform Readiness Check

These should already work — verify before onboarding:

- [ ] New user can register and log in
- [ ] Browse Events page shows events with filters
- [ ] Event detail modal opens with full info
- [ ] RSVP button works (shows confirmation, updates count)
- [ ] MyLane shows upcoming RSVPed events
- [ ] Business dashboard shows events and RSVP counts
- [ ] Mobile experience is usable (not perfect, but functional)

### If anything is broken:
Flag it in Claude Chat → get a Cursor prompt → fix before onboarding the next business.

---

## Feedback Collection

- [ ] After first week: ask each business what was easy, what was confusing
- [ ] After first event: ask 2-3 attendees how they found it, what they'd change
- [ ] Track in a simple list (notes app, Google Doc, whatever's fast)
- [ ] Bring feedback to Claude Chat for roadmap decisions

### Key questions:
- Was creating an event straightforward?
- Did the event page look right to you?
- Would you create more events on your own?
- What would make this more useful for your business?

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is done when:

- [ ] 3+ businesses have profiles and at least one event each
- [ ] 10+ real RSVPs from community members
- [ ] At least 1 event has actually happened with real attendees
- [ ] Feedback collected from at least 2 businesses and 3 attendees
- [ ] No critical bugs blocking the core flow

---

## What Comes Next

Once Phase 1 success criteria are met:
1. **Organism Phase 1** — Build the visual heart of the platform (single session)
2. **Stripe Payments** — After legal checklist is complete, start billing for real
3. **Expand beyond farms** — Use the farm program as proof to recruit other local businesses
