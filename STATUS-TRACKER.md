## 🚧 NEXT UP (Before Pilot)

### 🚀 Launch Roadmap

Three phases, in order. Each unlocks the next.

#### Phase 1: Farm Program (Content-First Launch) — NOW
Real businesses, real events, no code changes needed. The platform is ready for this today.

- [ ] Onboard 3-5 farm/food businesses (create accounts, set up profiles)
- [ ] Each business creates 2-3 real events (farm tours, workshops, markets)
- [ ] Facebook post driving community awareness (posted 2026-02-02)
- [ ] First real users browse, RSVP, attend
- [ ] Collect feedback from businesses and attendees
- [ ] Identify friction points before adding complexity
- **Why first:** Proves the platform works with real people. Generates the activity data the organism will eventually reflect. Builds the relationships that Community Pass revenue share depends on.
- **What's needed:** Doron's time onboarding businesses. Zero code.
- **Success criteria:** 3+ businesses with events, 10+ real RSVPs, feedback collected
- **Checklist:** See `checklists/farm-program-launch.md`

#### Phase 2: Organism Phase 1 — The Seed
Single build session. Makes the platform feel alive before money flows.

- [ ] Create `useVitality` hook (calculate from existing MyLane data)
- [ ] Create `CommunityOrganism.jsx` component (CSS + SVG animation)
- [ ] Place in MyLane GreetingHeader alongside greeting and punch badge
- [ ] 3-5 visual states: Seed → Sprouting → Growing → Thriving → Resting
- **Spec:** ORGANISM-CONCEPT.md (private repo)
- **Dependencies:** None — uses data already queried in MyLane
- **Note:** Decision filter for all features: "Does this make the organism more alive?" (DEC-029)

#### Phase 3: Stripe Payments (Community Pass Model)
Real money. Gated behind legal checklist.

- [ ] Phase A: Platform Setup — Stripe account config, products, webhook URL
- [ ] Phase B: Business Tier Subscriptions — real billing for business tiers
- [ ] Phase C: Business Connect Onboarding — link bank accounts
- [ ] Phase D: Community Pass Subscriptions — user membership billing
- [ ] Phase E: Direct Purchases — `on_behalf_of` checkout flow
- [ ] Phase F: Revenue Share Distribution — monthly pool distribution
- **Spec:** STRIPE-CONNECT.md (revised 2026-02-02, aligned with DEC-028)
- **Legal:** Must complete legal checklist before Phase B (see LEGAL-RESEARCH.md)
- **Priority:** HIGH — blocks real money flowing through platform

### Phase 3 Security Audit (DEC-025) — COMPLETE ✅
- [x] AdminSettings — service role migration + permissions locked (Phase 3a)
- [x] Location — permissions locked (Phase 3a)
- [x] Spoke — permissions locked (Phase 3a)

- [x] User — service role migration + permissions locked (Phase 3c)
- [x] RSVP — service role migration + permissions locked (Phase 3d)
- [x] Recommendation — service role migration + permissions locked (Phase 3d)

**Bugs fixed during audit:**
- Staff auto-link invite cleanup (stale cache invalidation)
- accept_invite action for non-owner users accepting staff invites

**Priority:** HIGH — must complete before pilot

### Mobile Polish Pass
- [ ] Test all pages on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Touch targets sized appropriately (44px minimum)
- [ ] Scroll behavior smooth on all sections
- [ ] Bottom nav / PWA considerations

## Session Log — 2026-02-08 (Strategy + Co-Owner Build)

**Strategy work:**
- ORGANISM-ARCHITECTURE-EVOLUTION.md written (private repo) — co-ownership, archetype dashboards, tier philosophy reframe, multi-community Forest concept
- SILVER-DIME-LAYER.md written (private repo) — parallel physical currency layer, cross-community bridge, Earn-Your-Pass integration, bullion dealer as organism node, legal firewall analysis
- Analog quest pattern discussed — Doron's kids already running silver dime quests at The Circuit. Life as a game in the real world, not gamification on a screen. Quests section ready to add to Silver Dime doc.

**Shipped today (co-owner role):**
1. Server auth: co-owner role added to canEditBusiness, canEditEvent, canManageEvent across 3 server functions (0df37d6)
2. UI: co-owner role in StaffWidget, BusinessEditDrawer, BusinessCard — dropdown, badge (amber outline), permission checks (5bf3454)
3. Bug fix: addStaffMutation was not writing role to staff_roles AdminSettings for direct-add users. Fixed (131f24d)
4. Verified end-to-end: role saves correctly, badge renders, data confirmed in Base44

**Decisions made:**
- DEC-043: Co-owner role via staff_roles (complete)
- DEC-044: TAB_CONFIG archetype dashboard pattern (designed)
- DEC-045: Silver dime layer as parallel physical currency (designed)
- DEC-046: Custom role permissions (designed, deferred)

**Private repo docs created:**
- ORGANISM-ARCHITECTURE-EVOLUTION.md
- SILVER-DIME-LAYER.md

**Bugs found and fixed:**
- addStaffMutation role write missing for direct-add flow (fixed, 131f24d)

**Next session priorities:**
- Lock DEC-043 co-owner decision in DECISIONS.md ← (this prompt)
- Add Quests section to SILVER-DIME-LAYER.md
- Mobile nav + device testing
- Settings display name bug
- Business onboarding wizard simplification

## Phase 1 Language Audit — Joy Coins & Community Pass

- [x] Full codebase search for "punch" — replaced with Joy Coin / Community Pass terminology
- [x] UI audit: no references to "punch card", "punch pass", or "stored value"
- [x] Database fields: documented legacy field names with mapping comments
- [x] Terms of Service: verified Community Pass + Joy Coin language (not stored value)
- [x] User-facing copy audit: MyLane, Business Dashboard, Event Detail
- [x] Confirm "Joy Coins" used consistently (not "tokens", "credits", "punches", "tickets")
- [ ] Privacy Policy: verify membership framing (not prepaid balance) — still needs review

---

## Session Log — 2026-02-05

**Focus:** Pricing strategy deep dive and decision locking

**Decisions locked (4 new):**
- DEC-032: Community Pass pricing — $49 base / $39 additional / 12 coins each
- DEC-033: Joy Coin pool model — coins not people, household shares pool
- DEC-034: Business tier pricing — Free / $79 Standard / $149 Partner
- DEC-035: Earn-Your-Pass — kids work farms/markets to earn access

**Research completed:**
- Crabtree's Simple Numbers: price for 10-15% profit, pay yourself market rate, protect margins
- ClassPass anti-model: extracts value, $6-15/visit to studios, 94% first-timers, <2% conversion
- 1Pass Eugene: 11K passes, 69K scans, $9.50/scan avg — validates scan-based pool in Eugene
- Eugene gym pricing: climbing $75-91/mo adult, gymnastics $80-120/mo per kid, trampoline $25/mo
- Off-peak strategy: 30-50% empty capacity weekdays, incremental revenue pitch to businesses
- Operating costs modeled: ~$5,450/mo, breakeven ~200 memberships

**Key insight:** Memberships are coin allocations, not person assignments. Simplifies everything — billing, UX, no "who's on the plan" tracking.

**Docs requiring update:**
- COMMUNITY-PASS.md → full rewrite (private repo)
- DECISIONS.md → add DEC-032 through DEC-035
- STRIPE-CONNECT.md → update product tables with real prices
- TIER-SYSTEM.md → lock business pricing
- LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md → check off pricing items, add new sections

**Next up:**
- Apply doc updates to repos
- Founding member rate decision
- Marketing deck (two versions: families + businesses)
- Launch buildout roadmap

- Introduced $9/month Microbusiness tier concept between free users and $79 Standard businesses
- Property management sub-type includes Crabtree financial model and guest-to-community bridge for Airbnb hosts
- Decision logged as DEC-039

**2026-02-07 — Nonprofit Archetype Expansion**
- **Focus:** Nonprofit archetype expansion and Eugene landscape research
- **Decisions locked (1 new):** DEC-040: Nonprofit pricing — 50% discount ($39 Standard, $79 Partner)
- **Spec updates:** nonprofit-node.md major update — 8 sub-types, nonprofit pricing tiers, expanded data model, Burrito Brigade and Ophelia's Place test cases, implementation phases, Organism connection
- **Research completed:** NONPROFIT-LANDSCAPE-EUGENE.md new research doc for private repo — 2,443 org ecosystem, detailed profiles, outreach priority list, revenue projections
- Eugene nonprofit density: 2,443 orgs, 17,711 employees, $2B revenue
- Burrito Brigade deep dive: 55 Little Free Pantries, 3 programs, founding partner candidate
- Ophelia's Place: youth empowerment across Lane & Linn counties
- FOOD for Lane County: Youth Farm connects to Earn-Your-Pass
- Grassroots Connect philosophy alignment: "What we practice at a small scale sets the patterns for the whole system"
